# AI-Powered Attrition Prediction System 

## VARIABLES

* Age: Represents the age of the employee in years. Age can correlate with experience, job satisfaction, and retention.

* Attrition: A categorical feature that indicates whether the employee has left the company ("Yes" or "No"). This is typically the target variable in attrition or employee turnover analysis.

* BusinessTravel: Categorizes how frequently the employee travels for business. Possible categories might include "Rarely," "Frequently," and "Non-Travel." Frequent business travel may impact job satisfaction and attrition.

* DailyRate: The daily wage of the employee. This feature can be used to analyze the financial aspect of employee satisfaction.

* Department: Categorical feature representing the department the employee works in, such as "Sales," "R&D," or "HR." Departmental differences can impact work environment and engagement.

* DistanceFromHome: Indicates the distance between the employee's home and workplace, measured in kilometers or miles. Longer commutes might be linked to job dissatisfaction and turnover.

* Education: Educational level attained by the employee, typically represented by an integer (e.g., 1 for high school, 2 for bachelor’s, etc.). Education level could correlate with salary, job role, and career progression.

* EducationField: The field of study in which the employee received their education (e.g., "Life Sciences," "Marketing"). This could influence job role suitability and satisfaction.

* EmployeeCount: A constant feature in this dataset, with the value set to 1 for all employees. It may not have predictive value but is included for completeness.

* EmployeeNumber: A unique identifier for each employee. This is a non-predictive feature used for record-keeping.

* EnvironmentSatisfaction: Measures employee satisfaction with their work environment on a Likert scale (1-4). Higher values indicate greater satisfaction, which may correlate with job performance and retention.

* Gender: Categorical feature indicating the employee’s gender. Gender may be used to analyze diversity, inclusion, and disparities in areas such as pay or promotion.

* HourlyRate: The hourly wage rate for the employee. Like DailyRate, it provides insight into the financial compensation received by the employee.

* JobInvolvement: Reflects the degree to which the employee is involved in their job on a Likert scale (1-4). Higher values indicate greater involvement, which may correlate with performance and retention.

* JobLevel: Represents the level or rank of the employee within the organization (e.g., entry-level, manager, senior manager). Job level may affect salary, responsibilities, and attrition.

* JobRole: Categorical feature denoting the employee's specific job role (e.g., "Sales Executive," "Manager"). This feature can provide insights into job fit and satisfaction.

* JobSatisfaction: Measures overall job satisfaction on a Likert scale (1-4). Higher values suggest higher satisfaction and lower attrition risk.

* MaritalStatus: The marital status of the employee (e.g., "Single," "Married," "Divorced"). Marital status may influence work-life balance and job engagement.

* MonthlyIncome: Represents the monthly salary of the employee. Income can directly affect employee satisfaction and retention.

* MonthlyRate: Similar to MonthlyIncome but calculated as a rate. This feature may provide an additional layer of financial analysis for the employee.

* NumCompaniesWorked: Indicates the number of companies the employee has worked for before their current job. This could be a predictor of job stability or risk of attrition.

* Over18: A categorical feature indicating whether the employee is over 18 years old. Since all employees are likely to be over 18, this feature may not provide any useful variation.

* OverTime: A categorical feature indicating whether the employee works overtime. Employees working frequent overtime may experience higher stress, impacting job satisfaction and attrition.

* PercentSalaryHike: The percentage increase in salary for the employee over the last year. This feature may influence retention and job satisfaction.

* PerformanceRating: An integer rating (likely 1-4) representing the employee’s performance. Higher values suggest better performance, which may be linked to higher pay or job retention.

* RelationshipSatisfaction: Measures satisfaction with workplace relationships on a Likert scale (1-4). Higher values suggest better relationships, which can impact job satisfaction and performance.

* StandardHours: The number of hours the employee is expected to work, typically standardized across all employees. This feature may be constant and not particularly predictive.

* StockOptionLevel: Indicates the level of stock options granted to the employee, which can influence financial incentives and retention.

* TotalWorkingYears: The total number of years the employee has been working, including their tenure at the current company. More experience may correlate with higher salary and lower attrition risk.

* TrainingTimesLastYear: Represents the number of training sessions the employee attended last year. Frequent training may be linked to skill development and job satisfaction.

* WorkLifeBalance: Measures the employee's satisfaction with their work-life balance on a Likert scale (1-4). Higher values indicate better balance, which may reduce attrition risk.

* YearsAtCompany: The number of years the employee has worked at the current company. Longer tenures may be linked to higher loyalty and lower attrition.

* YearsInCurrentRole: The number of years the employee has held their current position. Longevity in a role may correlate with job mastery and satisfaction.

* YearsSinceLastPromotion: Represents the number of years since the employee's last promotion. Longer times since promotion may impact job satisfaction and retention.

YearsWithCurrManager: Indicates the number of years the employee has worked with their current manager. Strong relationships with managers may positively affect job satisfaction and performance.
